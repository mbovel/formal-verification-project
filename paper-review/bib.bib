Here we show that SMT approaches can also efficiently solve problems that, at first sight, do not have a typical SMT flavor. In particular, here we deal with SAT and SMT problems where models M are sought such that a given cost function f(M) is minimized.For this purpose, we introduce a variant of SMT where the theory T becomes progressively stronger, and prove it correct using the Abstract DPLL Modulo Theories framework. We discuss two different examples of applications of this SMT variant: weighted Max-SAT and weighted Max-SMT. We show how, with relatively little effort, one can obtain a competitive system that, in the case of weighted Max-SMT in the theory of Difference Logic, can even handle well-known hard radio frequency assignment problems without any tailored heuristics. These results seem to indicate that Max-SAT/SMT techniques can already be used for realistic applications.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing}, pages = {156–169}, numpages = {14}, location = {Seattle, WA}, series = {SAT'06} }
