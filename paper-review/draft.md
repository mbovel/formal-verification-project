> In particular, fix the notation you will be using for your review.


# Body

> Explain the paper, in your own words. 
> Don't go into as many details as the original text, but the person reading your review should have a general understanding of the paper's results 
> and how those results can be obtained. The structure and content of this section of course heavily depends on the paper itself. 
> Don't hesitate to split it in multiple sections or subsections, for example:
> \subsection{An algorithm for whatever problem we try to solve}
> If your paper contains theorems, sketch the proofs of important theorems. 


# Benchmarks

> If it contains benchmarks, show the key scores or results.
> You can follow the structure of the paper you're reviewing, but write with your own words.


# Conclusion

> Recall briefly what the paper achieves, and how it is new. 
> Express your critical skil on the paper and explain what you think are the strong and weak points of the paper.
